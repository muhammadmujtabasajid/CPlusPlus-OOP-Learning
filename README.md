# 🚗 Total Cars (Static Members in C++)

This project demonstrates the use of **static data members** in C++ using a class that keeps track of the total number of cars created. It's a simple OOP example for understanding how static variables behave across multiple objects.

## 📂 Files Included

- `total_cars_static.cpp` – Main C++ source file
- `.gitignore` – Ignores unnecessary files for version control
- `LICENSE` – License for project usage
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

### 💻 On Windows (MinGW + VS Code)

Open terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
g++ total_cars_static.cpp -o total_cars
./total_cars
If you have tasks.json set up in VS Code, just press:
Ctrl + Shift + B
📌 Key Concepts
static data members shared across all instances

Class-based design

Object counters

🧪 Output


Car 1 created
Car 2 created
Car 3 created
Total cars: 3
